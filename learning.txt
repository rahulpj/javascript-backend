-> database is always in other continent 
-> so wrap it in try and catch also use async await.

-> 2 approches to do database connection, first write whole connection code in IIFEs(immediately invoked function expressions) with async await and try catch ans the other is take this whole code to a new folder db and in that place this code in index.js and export it and use it in index.js


Utilites

-> creating higher order function named asyncHandler which takes and async function needed to be executed and wrap it inside the try catch block to avoid writing it again and again

-> Custom ApiError and ApiResponse class


-> mongodb stores data in BSON (binary json)

-> Now creating user and video model
-> using aggregate pipeline in video for watch history
-> using bcrypt and jsonwebtoken in user model
-> using bcrypt for hashing the password and then storing it in database
-> mongoose provide some hooks like pre and post 
-> so using pre hook hashing the password and then storing it to database


schema.methods.methodName = function(arguments) {
  // `this` refers to the document instance
  return someResult;
};

-> adding instance methods for a model. These methods are available on document instances of that model. 
1) these methods work on a specific document instance, giving you the access to the documents field.
2) we can define any custom functionality like manipulating data, validating values or interacting with external APIs specific to a document

using these instance methods for verifying the user and generating access and refresh tokens for a particular document


File uploading

-> it is always better to keep this as a utility or in a middleware

-> using multer and cloudinary service
2 steps
-> using multer we will take file from user and upload to it local server on temporary basis 
-> cloudinary will take the file from local server to cloudinary server

we can also take the file from user through multer and directly upload it to cloudinary server but in production grade application ew temporarily keep the file in the local server to reattemp the upload if it fails in any case


HTTP 

-> Hyper text transfer protocol 

HTTP Headers
-> metadata-> key-value sent along with request and response 
-> caching, authentication, manage state
-> Request Headers         ->       from client
-> Response Headers        ->       from server   
-> Representation Headers  ->       ecoding/compression
-> Payload Headers         ->       data

Most Common Headers 

-> Accept : application/json
-> User-Agent : gives the information about the user like the browser or operating system from where the request is comming
-> Authorization : Bearer jsonwebtoken 
-> Content-Type : which type of data you are sending 
-> Cookie 
-> Cache-Control

HTTP Status code

1xx information
2xx Success
3xx Redirection
4xx Client error 
5xx Server error 

200 OK
201 Created
202 accepted
400 bad request 
404 not found 
401 Unauthorized
 

Controller and Routes

-> creating user controller and routes 
-> using user controller in user routes and using user routes in app.js using middleware 
-> maintaining industry standart by keeping the path of routes as /api/v1/name
