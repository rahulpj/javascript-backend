-> database is always in other continent 
-> so wrap it in try and catch also use async await.

-> 2 approches to do database connection, first write whole connection code in IIFEs(immediately invoked function expressions) with async await and try catch ans the other is take this whole code to a new folder db and in that place this code in index.js and export it and use it in index.js
